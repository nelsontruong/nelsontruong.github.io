															</li>
														</ul>
													<h5>Context and Problem</h5>
														<ul>
															<u>Fiat Chrysler Automotives</u>
															<ul>
																<li>5 main international brands operating independently. This
																	resulted in a design inconsistenices, unalignment, and slow turnaround time
																	to update basic vehicle pages along with the inability to scale to more quickly re-design
																	complex tools (such as Finding a Dealer on a map, or Scheduling a Test Drive).
																</li>
															</ul>
														</ul>
													<h5>My Role</h5>
														<ul>
															
															<u>Architecting components for brand teams designed responsively across 4 breakpoints - Desktop, Tablet, Phablet, Mobile</u>
															
															<ul>
																<li>
																	This involved gathering of user requirements, determining brand and user value, performing
																	 a competitive experience analysis and determining if the component aligns with the 
																	 philosophy of the design system (such re-using previous subcomponents, re-using defined colors,
																	 fonts, and if it should be made as an existing variation or a new component altogether).
																</li>
																<br>
																<li>
																	The design of a component enables speed and velocity when authoring content. An authored image 
																	only needs to be defined once and it will automatically adjust accordingly maintaining its aspect
																	ratio on smaller breakpoints. The same goes for font sizes and subcomponents like an arrow.
																</li>
															</ul>
															
															<u>Whiteboarding with Visual Designers and Developers</u>
															
															<ul>
																<a class="image"><img src="images/Gallery_Whiteboard.jpg" alt="Gallery Whiteboard Image" /></a>
																<li>
																	Whiteboarding sessions were held for components in conjunction with visual designers
																	and developers. Whiteboarding replaced the need to make wires for many components. Any issues
																	with UX, Development, or Visual Design are discussed at this stage.
																	<br><br>
																</li>
																<li>
																	Because of a componentized framework within a design system, we must always design for the worst case
																	scenario from the content authors perspective (shoving as much content into the component) and consider
																	the systems requirements hosted from FCA server-side (render times, load speeds, number of image combinations
																	for a color, wheel and vehicle model variation).
																</li>
															</ul>
															
															<u>Working with Visual Designers to Refine the End Product</u>
															
																<ul>
																	<a class="image"><img src="images/Gallery.PNG" alt="Gallery Image" /></a>
																	<li>
																		On the FCA Product Team, I work in tandem with the Visual Designer side-by-side and
																		go straight from the whiteboarding phase directly to visual design. 
																		Wires are made for complex components, and interactions not defined in the design system framework.
																		Even when wires are made, they are usually high level because the most of it has already been defined
																		at the component framework level.
																	</li>
																</ul>
																
															<u>Documenting the final design requirements and syncing with the Business Analyst</u>
															
																<ul>
																	<li>
																		We start off by documenting the general structure of a component where 
																		documentation is done by linking subcomponents with a complex component design. 
																		Attributes in components can inherit or be specified by the CMS author. 
																	</li>
																	<br>
																	<li>
																		The example below is a component map made for a Feature Panel. A feature panel
																		inherits traits from subcomponents such as a display media and is composed of other
																		subcomponents such as the description block. The description block has its own
																		set of unique attributes. The component map provides a high level overview of the component structure.
																		<a class="image"><img src="images/Component Map.png" alt="Component Map Image" /></a>
																		<br><br>
																		To simplify things for developers and QA teams, visual annotations are made:
																		<a class="image"><img src="images/Feature Panel Annotation.png" alt="Feature Panel Component Image" /></a>
																		<br><br>
																		Front-end requirements would be synced and aligned with back-end requirements.
																		<a class="image"><img src="images/Component Attributes.png" alt="Attributes Image" /></a>
																		<br><br>
																		Accessibility requirements are then defined such as specifying the Aria-Live region of where
																		a screenreader would read out to a user where there would occur an action or state change.
																		<a class="image"><img src="images/Accessibility.png" alt="Accessibility Example Image" /></a>
																	</li>
																</ul>
															</ul>
															<h5>Challenges</h5>
															<ul>
																<u>Brands teams not understanding a design system</u>
																<ul>
																	<li>
																		Brands did not realize components are all interconnected. 
																		One change permeates throughout the rest of the experience for other brands. A change to a
																		subcomponent can also break other components that are dependent on the subcomponent. For example,
																		if a team wanted to change the core functionality of a component, they didn't realize it
																		would effect other brands using the same component. I mitigated this by continuously
																		communicating with the brand teams and put myself forward as the go-to person for design
																		system questions.
																	</li>
																</ul>
																<u>Responsive approach for all components</u>
																<ul>
																	<li>
																		There are some components where content requirements or asset sizing cause problems on smaller breakpoints.

																		An example is the hero. On Desktop, the image is long and wide but on mobile, the same image would not appear well.
																		To compensate for this, the team modified the hero be adaptive on smaller breakpoints to be tall and narrow.
																		<br>
																		Hero Image that is used on all breakpoints in our Responsive Hero:
																		<a><img src="images/Ugly Jeep Hero.PNG" alt="Ugly Jeep Hero Image" /></a>
																		<br><br>
																		Hero Image designed to be adaptive:
																		<br>
																		<a><img src="images/Adaptive RAM Hero.PNG" alt="Adaptive RAM Hero Image" /></a>
																	</li>
																</ul>
																	<u>Offshore Development</u>
																<ul>
																	<li>
																		Working with developers in India present unique challenges to time zones and cultural differences. 
																		When we received the platform back, there were large gaps in the expectation of quality. The design team operated 
																		under the assumption that the development team would implement assumed features.
																		For example, if a tab is in its selected state, selecting another tab should move the selected state to it.
																		Another example, the hand icon should appear when hovering over an interactive element on Desktop.
																		But this did not happen when we received the component back.
																		I've since learned to be as prescriptive as possible and operate under no assumptions for developers. This has
																		yielded the highest quality of work.
																	</li>
																</ul>
																	<u>Usability Testing to validate design</u>
																<ul>
																	<li>
																		Unfortunately, this was a problem I could not overcome as the client was unwilling to invest money into user testing.
																		As a result, many of our designs were only validated internally and largely by the product owners client side. 
																	</li>
																</ul>
															</ul>
															<h5>Results</h5>
															<ul>
																<li>
																	A consistent experience across 5 brands completed within a year. My manager put it best. Since we were going
																	so fast, it was like flying an airplane but building it at the same time. Click through rates jumped drastically but most 
																	importantly - speed of execution multiplied. This saved huge amounts of effort in terms of development, content creation, and design. 
																	Strategically, it allowed FCA to focus more efforts on vehicle tools to offer user value, campaigns, launches, etc.
																</li>
																<br>
																<li>
																	Here are the same 3 components, on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile,
																	used in 4 different locations on the home page for Jeep, Fiat, Chrysler, and RamTrucks.  It takes a content author 
																	seconds to author each component or to copy and put it on another page.

												<h5>Context and Problem</h5>
												<u>FCA International - Japan, Korea, India, Caribbean, Argentina</u>
													<ul>
														<li>
															Inefficiencies and inability to scale their digital platform similar to the U.S.
															market site. The goal was to bring the platform on board and fully operating international
															sites within a 5 month period (2 months design, 3 months development and content authoring)
														</li>
													</ul>
												<h5>My Role</h5>
												<ul>
													<u>Lead UX and architect international sites and design (or modify) components for each 
														FCA International Market</u>
													<ul>
														<li>
															Design pages for the international site using existing components if possible. I would design 
															new components if necessary. The wire shown below is made in Sketch and an example that I collaborated with another UX
															designer Jenna as we jammed through all the rest of the international market pages.
														</li>
														<a class="image"><img src="images/Jeep Japan Wire Example.png" alt="Jeep Japan Wire" /></a>
														<br><br>
														<li>
															<b>How did we structure the pages and why did we do them a certain way?</b>
															We examined existing web pages and mapped those web pages on how they would be created 
															using our current component framework. We then modified the page with different components
															(or enhancements to compoenents) and created templates in Excel to keep track of all variations.
															In total, we had over 50 templates for the International markets, most being one-off pages.
															<a class="image"><img src="images/International Templates.png" alt="Templating Image" /></a>
															<br><br>
														</li>
														<li>
															We followed this method of using components that would work with their current design
															as a way of providing our international clients with an experience they
															are familiar and already aligned with. If there are design or usability improvements, we reflect
															that in the templates and discussions. Using Excel provided us an organized method to keep track of 
															all the site URLs we had to re-design. The below image shows an example of half a worksheet for one
															market.
															<a class="image"><img src="images/Jeep Japan Excel.png" alt="Jeep Japan Excel Document" /></a>
														</li>
													</ul>
												<ul>
													<u>Take charge of multiple roles - Fill the role of a Business Analyst as well as being the principal UX Designer</u>
													<ul>	
														<li>
															At the start of the project, there was a gap where the BA position was not filled by anyone. 
															As a result, I would also architect the back-end requirements and also gather the functional /
															user requirements in addition to my role as the principal UX designer on this project
														</li>
													</ul>
												</ul>
												<ul>
													<u>Establish a working design relationship with clients</u>
													<ul>
														<li>
															The approach for this project was more in line with a waterfall method and
															we had regular reviews with the client where I would showcase component and page designs via conferencing.
															As a pain point, I would not have the chance to review final authored page designs
															provided by the content author before presenting to the client. The goal of our design was really to simplify
															the content displayed on each market's site and bring forward consistency for future scalability. This helped
															me introduce systems design thinking to our clients.
														</li>
													</ul>
												</ul>
												<h5>Challenges</h5>
												<ul>
													<u>Lack of Cultural Context and Understanding</u>
												<ul>
												<li>
													One of my goals in the beginning was to do a Netnography and User Testing to understand
													how users in different areas of the world would use automobile sites differently. Due to budget constraints
													and user testing being a low priority for FCA, this was not moved forward.
												</li>
												</ul>
													<u>Around the world communication</u>
												<ul>
													<li>
														Clients were located in Asia, Development Team located in India, Design Team located in Toronto.
														It was a challenging coordinating efforts and resulted in lots of wasted time waiting for client
														approval.
													</li>
												</ul>
												<u>Organization</u>
													<ul>
														<li>
															The design team was tasked not only with design, but to organize all the URLs and to keep track of 
															progress ourselves. With 300+ sites, this became very difficult at first to match the sites to 
															corresponding templates. Even more difficult when the client came back and wanted to change templates
															affecting multiple sites. As a result, we simplified by working in batches and only changing templates
															when absolutely necessary. Tools such as Trello were used to allow for greater team visibilty.
														</li>
													</ul>
												</ul>												
												<h5>Results</h5>
												<ul>
													<li>
														I had fantastic team members for visual design and UX to help complete this project together - Yuko, Jenna, Karen, Joyce. <br>
													</li>
													<br>
													<li>
														And the site went from this:
														<a class="image"><img src="images/Old Jeep Wrangler.png" alt="Old Jeep Wrangler Japan Site" /></a>
													</li>
													<br>
													<li>
														To this state (Once the components were modified, it took the content author 5 minutes to get this up):

												<h5>RAM Commercial Custom Graphics Tool</h5>
												<a class="image"><img src="images/Logoizer.PNG" alt="RAM Commercial Custom Graphics Tool" /></a>
												<div class="inner">
													<br>
													<h5>Context and What I Did</h5>
													<ul>
														<li>
															RAM Commercial wanted a software to be used at dealerships to show small to medium sized
															business owners what their logo would look like on a RAM. It's like a Microsoft Paint
															Tool that you can use on ramtrucks.com. The purpose of this tool wasn't to let users design
															in detail, but rather as an exploration tool to get
															them excited and imaginative as a selling feature at dealerships.
														</li>
													</ul>
												<h5>My Role</h5>	
													<ul>
														<u>UX lead for this project.</u> 
														<ul>
															<li>
																This involved gathering the requirements, leading the interaction
																design and execution for this project.
															</li>
															<br>
															<li>
																<b>How did I gather requirements or do analysis?</b> A competitve landscape analysis was 
																quite difficult to do as there were no competitors in the automotive industry that offered
																this tool. Therefore, I had to take inspiration from similar tools such as T-Shirt or Logo 
																Design online web applications. At the end of my analysis, my research indicated the tool had
																to be extremely simple - not be like a photoshop, work seamlessly across all 4 breakpoints 
																and always surface functionalities to be visible to the user. Nothing could be beneath the fold.
															</li>
															<br>
															<li>
																<b>Why did I come to these requirements?</b> They were also in line with the philosphy of the project.
																Having a tool simple to use and all interactive elements are inline with RAM truck owners who are 
																NOT technically savvy at all. Any state changes need to be clearly communicated. CTAs would need to be
																very noticeable and large. These end goals are needed for our end target user. 
															</li>
														</ul>
													</ul>
												<h5>Challenges</h5>
													<ul>
														<u>No user testing or user research</u>
															<ul>
																<li>The client was not willing to pay for it, so this tool was
																designed on open-ended requirements and key assumptions provided by the RAM client and 
																the limited user research allocated time before project kickoff.
																</li>
															</ul>
													</ul>
													<ul>
														<u>Adaptive approach rather than responsive</u>
														<ul>
															<li>
																Not all functionalities worked well on Mobile, especially when configuring with tools that were
																detailed oriented (such as adding custom text). Additionally, adding in many visual layers (text, images, etc.)
																do not meet the system requirements as it would be very slow on mobile phones. As a solution, an adaptive approach
																for some functionalities (such as adding custom text) were removed from phablet and mobile. This provided
																a better streamlined experience on mobile but still allowed the user to use and play with features that were most 
																important to them.
																<br>
																<a><img src="images/Logoizer Mobile.PNG" alt="RAM Commercial Custom Graphics Tool Mobile"/></a>
															</li>
														</ul>
													</ul>
												<h5>Results</h5>
													<ul>
														<li>
															The client and dealerships were excited about the simplicity combined with the functionality of this tool.
															CTAs, labels, and interactive elements were clear in what they did. Lastly, a responsive web graphics
															design editor is rarely seen online and the client had high regards on us pushing FCA to be the digital frontier 
															for automotive experiences.

												<h5>Cadillac Fairview Santa Signup</h5>
												<br>
													<h5>Context and What I Did</h5>
													<ul>
														<u>Lead UX to increase Click Through Rates and streamline user registration for Santa Photo Signup
														at Cadillac Fairview Malls</u> <br><br>
														<li>
															My recommendation were 2 options:
														</li>
														<br>
														<ul>
															<li>
																Option 1) Move the Calendar to the top and shorten the "Visit with Santa Module" to only include key dates and
																remove extra line spacing. This would push the calendar to be above the fold. Users are able to see key dates 
																as they are choosing the date on the calendar. 
															</li>
															<br>
															<li>
																Option 2) Change the Visit with Santa module to be only a header module (cannot change the Blue "Events" banner for the purposes
																of site hierarchy). Move the calendar up so it is in the view of the user's viewport on initial page load and it implies for for the user.
															</li>
														</ul>
														What was Designed:
														<a class="image"><img src="images/Designed_Santa_Signup.png" alt="Designed Santa Signup Calendar" /></a>
														<br>

														<li>
															In the end, the client was very persistent about keeping the "Visit with Santa" module at
															the top with key dates clearly outlined. This was similar to last year's approach that they were comfortable with. 
														</li>
														<br>
														<li>
															The design of the calendar featured blue labels and colouring for any interactive elements, such as changing
															the month or selecting tabs. Dates were in an inactive state. On hover of the date items changed to a light blue color
															with the active state using a darker blue. An accessibility tool (Chrome addon) was used to examine contrast for
															AA compliancy. On the right side of the calendar are time slots with corresponding icons to choose throughout the day. 
															If there were no times in the "morning", "afternoon", or "evening" tab, those tabs would be disabled. If all morning
															slots were filled or none available, then it would default the user to the next available tab and the morning tab would be 
															disabled.
														</li>
														<br>
														<li>
															<b>Why did we divide it up the time intervals?</b> There were many days where there would be 15 mins pers signup slot for 10+ hours.
															This meant the user would have to scroll a lot in order to reach times at night. To mitigate this, tabs corresponding to morning, afternoon
															and evening with text labels to show the time were implemented. We also used terms such as "Open" to 12:00 PM and 
															6:00 PM to "Close". Open and Close were used because malls would open and close at different times. It would be too
															much of a development effort to retrieve the opening and closing hours of each mall dynamically.
															Once the user clicks on "reserve", it redirected the user to an event registration "e-commerce checkout" page. At this point
															there was no more design input as the checkout page was handled by a 3rd party vendor.
														<br>
														</li>
														<br>
														<h5>
															What was Implemented (Challenges):
														</h5>
														<a class="image"><img src="images/Santa_Signup.png" alt="Santa Signup Calendar" /></a>
														<br>
														<ul>
															<li>
																The top section ended up containing a lot of content and pushed the calendar far down the page. As a designer, this is partially my 
																responsibility for not being able to convince the client to put less content. Additionally, the design requirement of disabling tabs in days
																that did not have any openings should have been disabled. In the visual above, December 10th only has openings in the 
																evening, but the morning, and afternoon tabs were never disabled with the evening tab is not defaulted to the 
																selected state.
